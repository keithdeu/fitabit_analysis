# How Do Consumers Use Smart Devices?

The above files include the cleaned Excel Data, SQL queries, Tableau Workbook, and Tableau Dashboard visualization in PDF format.

In this project, I analyze smart device data for the marketing team of a fictional Bellabeat, in order to give insights on how consumers tend to use these devices. 

I began my analysis by joining all daily activity data into one table, and all hourly activity data into one table. These tables are named joinedDailyActivity_merged and hourlyActivity_merged respectively. Once joined, I used excel to check for duplicate rows and remove them if necessary to ensure clean data.

I then uploaded these cleaned datasets into Tableau Desktop for further analysis. Through visualizing the number of times users used specific smart device features, I was able to show that users tend to track their number of calories, number of steps, and total distance far more then tracking their weight and sleep. I also was able to show what time of day, on average, customers tended to use their smart devices.
